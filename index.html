<h2>CHAPTER I—SOMETHING ABOUT A BUFFALO</h2>

<p>“Do you really suppose such a buffalo exists?” queried Chet Havens, who
  was braiding a whiplash.</p>

  <p><span class="pirata block">“You’ve got me there, boy,” </span>said his chum, Dig Fordham, trying for the
hundredth time to carve his initials in the adamantine surface of the
old horse-block, and with a dull jackknife.<p>

<p>“By the last hoptoad that was chased out of Ireland! wouldn’t it be just
the Jim-dandy adventure, Chet, if we could go out after this herd and
  capture the king of them all? It would be _great_!”</p>

<p>“It would be great enough, all right,” admitted Chet, nodding. “But it
would be some contract to capture such a bull. According to all accounts
  he must be as strong as an elephant and almost as big.”</p>

  <p>“Whew! do you think so, Chet?”</p>

  <p>“If he measures up anywhere near to the specifications that Tony</p>
  <p>Traddles gave us last week.”</p>

<p>“Oh—Tony!” returned Dig, in disgust. “If he saw a lizard sitting on a
  log in the sun he’d declare it was the size of a crocodile.”</p>

<p>Chetwood Havens laughed. He was a nice-looking, fair-haired boy with
grey-blue eyes and long, dextrous, capable hands. He braided the thongs
  without giving them more than a casual and cursory glance.</p>

<p>He was a tall boy, and slender, but with plenty of bodily strength.
Digby Fordham was more sturdily built. He was square-set,
broad-shouldered and thick-chested; and he had a broad, good-humoured
  face as well. His black hair was crisp;</p><h1 class="foot"> he had little, twinkling eyes;
  and usually his countenance wore a smile.</h1>
